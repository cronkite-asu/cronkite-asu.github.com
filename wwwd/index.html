      	 <p><b>Q: How should I go about interviewing an officer about an incident?</b> </p>
    	 
    	 <p><b>A:</b> Often, a Public Information Officer (PIO) will be at the scene if intensive media attention is expected. 
    	 PIOs often are the only representatives at a scene. If you would like to interview an officer instead of a PIO, 
    	 visit the local police station or ask the PIO to set up a contact for you.</p>
	 <p>Become familiar with the Sunshine Laws in your state to know what information 
	 a police officer is required to provide.</p>
         <p>Viewing an arrest log can answer a lot of questions. Once you find an arrest that piques your interest, 
         request a copy of the arrest report then interview the arresting officer for further details.</p>
         
   	 <p><b>Q: How do I talk to victims and family of victims?</b></p> 
         
         <p><b>A:</b> When approaching a victim, identify yourself as a reporter but be sure to establish a human connection 
         by expressing sympathy, condolences etc. Leave all equipment behind.</p> <p>Know what you are going to say in order 
         to avoid missteps, which can discourage the victim. Emphasize that you are giving them the opportunity to tell 
         their story. Use silence to allow a response.</p> <p>If they decline, don’t push, but instead ask if they can 
         recommend any other people to interview. Be sure to leave a business card so that the victim can contact you 
         if necessary to follow up. Ask for contact information and be sure to call back for afterthoughts or omitted 
         details.</p>

      <div data-role="content">	
    	<p><b>Q: Can bloggers get the same access to public meetings? </b> </p>
    	
    	<p><b>A:</b> Yes, theoretically, because you are exercising your First Amendment right to gather and disseminate 
    	news. However, bloggers and other non-mainstream journalists should know that they might encounter some 
    	resistance because many officials do not view them as legitimate journalists.</p>
    	
    	<p>Open meetings laws allow anyone to attend most federal, state and local government meetings. They also 
    	entitle everyone to receive advance notice about when and where meetings will be held in a reasonable amount 
    	of time. In most states, meetings by city and county agencies, school districts, agency boards and commissions 
    	are also public.</p>
    	
    	<p>However, these laws can vary from state to state and do not give access to every government meeting. An 
    	agency can hold a partial or fully closed meeting for a variety of issues including official misconduct, 
    	personnel issues, pending litigation, the purchase of real estate or anything that could release personal 
    	information about an individual or reveal trade secrets.</p>
    	
    	<p>When a closed meeting is permitted varies among states and between federal and state entities.</p>
    	
    	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AL">Alabama law requires that accurate minutes of all meetings are kept including information about the location and time of the meetings as well as the list of members present.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AL">All votes on matters before a governmental body must be made during the open or public portion of a meeting and voice votes are allowed.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AL">No votes can be taken in executive sessions and a governmental body may not vote by secret ballot.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AL">The law also permits any individual attending the meeting to record the meeting by using any audio or video recording device.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AL">The Alabama Open Meetings Act grants the right to attend meetings covered by the Act to the public generally. Ala. Code §  36-25A-2(7) (Supp. 2005).</p>
       	
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AK">All Alaska meetings, including teleconferencing, of an Alaska governmental body of a public entity are open to the public, unless exempt by statute.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AK">While not expressly exempt, advisory committees are not subject to the same enforcement of the law as are public bodies that decide policy.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AK">Alaska's Open Meetings Act (OMA) (AS 44.62.310-.312) protects the right of any member of the public to attend public meetings. AS 44.62.310(a)</p>
       	
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AZ">Arizona law states that a meeting is defined as any gathering of a quorum of the members of a public body in order to deliberate and decide on public policy. These provisions include emails and telephone conversations under the definition of open meetings.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AZ">Notable exemptions to this definition include prison hearings, where the governing body can: prohibit the attendance of individuals who pose a threat to the individuals at the hearing, require the signing of an attendance log, prevent articles from being taken in and excluding recording devices and search individuals in attendance.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AZ">All persons so desiring shall be permitted to attend and listen to the deliberations and proceedings” of any public meeting. A.R.S. § 38-431.01(A).  The Open Meetings Law (“OML”), however, does not provide for active public participation in the meeting. Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. Nos. I84-133, I83-49. Meetings may not be conducted in a language (e.g., Navajo) if its use prevents the public from understanding the business of the meeting.  Ariz. Att’y Gen. Op. No. I84-133.</p>
       	
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AR">The Arkansas Open Meetings Law is a part of the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act and legislates the methods by which public meetings are conducted. Statutes 25-19-101 through 25-19-109 of the State code define the law. The statement of purpose of the Open Meetings Act states, "It is vital in a democratic society that public business be performed in an open and public manner so that the electors shall be advised of the performance of public officials and of the decisions that are reached in public activity and in making public policy. Toward this end, this chapter is adopted, making it possible for them or their representatives to learn and to report fully the activities of their public officials."</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AR">Because the FOIA provides that meetings “shall be public,” Ark. Code Ann. § 25-19-106(a), it appears that anyone may attend, including representatives of the news media. However, only an Arkansas citizen may bring an action under the FOIA claiming a violation of the act. Ark. Code Ann. § 25-19-107(a). See Ark. Op. Att’y Gen. No. 97-016.</p>
       	
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CA">California law defines meetings as any congregation or teleconferencing of a majority of the members of a local public body with the intention of deliberating public matters. The law also explicitly states that public bodies cannot use communication methods, like email, to circumvent the Brown act.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CA">Notable exemptions to this definition include: The attendance of public conferences whose topic is governmental actions, so long as the members of the public agency do not meet separately but only participate in the conference, open and publicized meetings organized by private individuals to discuss public topics, and purely social or ceremonial events, where the board does not separate to privately discuss public matters.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CA">Many local jurisdictions, including San Francisco, Contra Costa County, and Oakland, have adopted local "Sunshine" provisions that increase the access and openness to the public.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CA">Attendance cannot be conditioned on registering, completing a questionnaire, signing an attendance list, or providing other information. Cal. Gov't Code §§ 11124 (Bagley-Keene Act); 54953.3 (Brown Act). If such a list or questionnaire is posted near the entrance or circulated during the meeting, it must state that completion is voluntary and that all persons may attend regardless of whether they complete the document. Cal. Gov't Code §§ 11124 (Bagley-Keene Act); 54953.3 (Brown Act).</p>
       	
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CO">Colorado law states that all meetings of two or more members of any state public body where any public business is discussed must be open to the public. This definition includes in person, telephone, or electronic communications. The law states that a gathering of a quorum or three or more individuals of a local body constitutes a meeting. The law also explicitly states that emailed messages discussing pending actions constitutes meetings and are subject to the law.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CO">Although who constitutes the "public" is not defined in the statute, it has been expressly held to allow the attendance of "citizens," see Littleton Educ. Ass'n v. Arapahoe Cty. School Dist. No. 6, 191 Colo. 411, 553 P.2d 793 (1976) (local agencies); Cole v. State, 673 P.2d 345 (Colo. 1983) (state agencies); and, by implication, to the media.</p>
       	
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CT">The Connecticut act defines meetings as all gatherings of or communications to a quorum of members of a multi-member public agency with the intention of discussing or deciding on public policy.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CT">Notable exemptions to this definition include: employment search committees for executive positions, chance meetings, collective bargaining single party caucus meetings and if the group does not constitute a quorum.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CT"> FOIA states that "[t]he meetings of all public agencies, except executive sessions as defined in subdivision (6) of section 1-200, shall be open to the public." Conn. Gen. Stat. §1-225(a). FOIA also provides: "[n]o member of the public shall be required, as a condition to attendance at a meeting of [a public agency], to register the member's name, or furnish other information, or complete a questionnaire or otherwise fulfill any condition precedent to the member's attendance." Conn. Gen. Stat. §1-225(e).</p>
       	
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_DC">Under D.C. law, the term "meeting" applies to gatherings "at which official action of any kind is taken," including hearings. This broad definition includes most gatherings where a multi-member government body takes action on a public matter.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_DC">The D.C. Sunshine Act gives "the public" the right to attend the meetings of D.C. government bodies. D.C. law does not limit access to meetings to a specific category of people or a profession, such as "the traditional press." Anyone may attend the meetings covered by the Act.</p>
	
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_DE">Delaware law states that all gatherings of a quorum of members of a public body, whether formal, informal or through video conferencing, with the intention of discussing public business are considered meetings.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_DE">Any citizen of Delaware, subject to certain exceptions, may attend a "meeting." 29 Del. C. § 10001; A "meeting" is defined as a "formal or informal gathering of a quorum of the members of any public body for the purpose of discussing or taking action on public business.</p>
       	
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_FL">Florida law states that all meetings of any governmental body where official acts will be taken are public meetings.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_FL"> The Florida law opens government meetings to the public, with no restrictions on who may attend.  Under the Sunshine Law, a meeting is either fully open or fully closed; there are no intermediate categories. Zorc v. City of Vero Beach, 722 So. 2d 891, 901 (Fla. 4th DCA 1998).</p>
       	
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_GA">Georgia law defines meetings as any gathering of a quorum of members of a public body where business will be discussed or action will be taken.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_GA">Notable exceptions to this definition include: The on-site inspection of facilities and meetings with other agencies outside of the original agencies jurisdiction, where no action is taken.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_GA">Any member of the "public," i.e., any person, can attend meetings under the Open Meetings Act. O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1(b)-(c).</p>
       	
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_HI">Hawaii law defines meetings as any gathering of a quorum of a public body.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_HI">Every meeting of all boards is open to the public with a few exceptions. The boards must allow anyone interested an opportunity to submit data, views, or arguments, in writing, on any agenda item. Attendees must be allowed to present oral testimony on any agenda item.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_HI">"[A]ll persons" may attend, but any person "who willfully disrupts a meeting to prevent and compromise the conduct of the meeting" may be removed. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 92-3.</p>
       	
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_ID">Idaho law defines a meeting as any convening of a government body to deliberate and decide on public matters. This definition includes all meetings conducted through telecommunication.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_ID">Notable exemptions include deliberations from the following groups, involving hearings and the discussions of the legal rights and duties of an individual: board of tax appeals, public utilities commission,and industrial commission.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_ID">In Idaho, meetings of a governing body of a public agency are open to the public unless closure of such meetings is expressly permitted under the Open Meeting Law. Idaho Code § 67-2342(1). The meetings are expressly open to the “public and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting.” Idaho Code § 67-2342(1). Although “public” and “persons” are not defined terms under the Law, there is nothing in the law to suggest that any distinction is to be made between different members of the public, whether they are citizens, residents, journalists or otherwise.</p>
       	
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_IL">Illinois law states that all meetings, whether in person or by video or audio conference, telephone call, electronic means of any sort, where a majority of a quorum of a public body (or three members for a five-member body) meets to discuss or act on business in any way shall be open to the public except when the General Assembly determines the meeting closed.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_IL">Any person may attend a public meeting; the Illinois Open Meetings Act, 5 ILCS 120/1 to 6, makes no distinction between members of the news media and members of the general public.</p>
       	
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_IN">Indiana law states that a "meeting" is defined as a gathering of a majority of the governing body of a public agency for the purpose of taking official action upon public business. All meetings of the governing bodies of public agencies must be open at all times to permit members of the public to observe and record them.</p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_IN">Members of the public. Ind. Code § 5-14-1.5-3(a). At the heart of the Open Door Law is the requirement that meetings of "the governing bodies of public agencies" must be open to allow members of the public to "observe and record them." Id.

    	<p><b>Q: Should I interview children?   </b> </p>
    	
    	<p><b>A:</b> Avoid interviewing young children, especially if they have witnessed a traumatic event. It is essential 
    	to talk to a child in the presence of a parent and get parental consent before publishing or broadcasting the 
    	interview. If it is essential to talk to the child do so with an adult present - in a quiet place, away from 
    	the excitement of the scene. Do not, however, separate a child from his parent or guardian to interview her. 
    	Before publishing a photo of a child, get permission from a parent or legal guardian.</p>

       	<p><b>Q: Can I film at a school?</b></p>
       	
       	<p><b>A:</b> Recording inside spaces at public schools is typically up to the school's governing board. The school 
       	does not have to allow recording inside classrooms, the school gym or dorm rooms. You may record a public 
       	school from a public sidewalk but be careful about using identifiable images of children. If you must record, 
       	try to get shots of the school name or marquee only. However, the best practice is to get permission before 
       	setting up your camera at a school.</p>
       	
       	<p>A private campus, on the other hand, can usually ban recording at its discretion. In a few states, there 
       	may be a right to record in privately owned areas open to the general public, such as private campus sidewalks 
       	and lawns, but the general rule is that a private campus can set its own regulations regarding access and 
       	filming.</p>
 	
 	<p>The technique of recording students from behind or in a way that would not identify them is a good way 
 	to persuade officials to grant permission.</p>

       <div data-role="content">	
    	<p><b>Q: Private property vs. public property: Where do they differ? </b> </p>
    	
    	<p><b>A:</b> Rules vary drastically between rights on private and public property. Generally, there are few 
    	limits placed on reporters' actions while on public property, however on private property you typically 
    	need prior permission before recording.</p>
    	
    	<p><i>Private Property:</i> Reporters on private property trying to cover news without consent can be subject 
    	to charges of trespassing or invasion of privacy charges. This includes any location with a private owner, 
    	i.e. residences, shopping centers, businesses, etc. Journalists who obtain permission from a public agency 
    	official are not protected from legal action and risk possible claims of trespassing, invasion of privacy 
    	and illegal search and seizure. It's best to call ahead to request permission from the property owner before 
    	trying to record on private property.</p>
    	
    	<p><i>Public property:</i> Under most circumstances, journalists have full access to places where the public 
    	is welcome unless there have been special provisions made for a specific event. This includes most 
    	government-owned locations, places such as streets, sidewalks and parks. </p>
       	
       	<p><b>Q: How do I get permission to interview people on private property?</b></p>
       
 	<p><b>A:</b> In most situations, journalists are not permitted to cover an event or interview on private property 
       	without prior permission. It's best to call several days in advance to request permission, especially if you 
       	are dealing with businesses or corporations. Often, a local branch needs to contact the corporate office 
       	before they can grant permission.</p>
       
        <p>Be friendly, forthright and persistent. If you do not hear back in a day or two, call again and ask how 
       	the approval process is going.</p>
       	
       	<p>Businesses may often impose restrictions on what you can or cannot record while on private property. This 
       	is often requires a negotiation as there is no set of hard and fast rules. The key to getting what you want 
       	is building trust with the source.</p>

       	<p><b>Q: Can I record in a restaurant or retail location?</b></p>
       
       <p><b>A:</b> You need permission from the owner or manager to record or photograph in a restaurant or retail location. 
       	It's best to get clearance in advance of recording, a process that can take several days. No permission is 
       	required if you are just recording the outside of the store, or other areas that are visible to the public - 
       	while on public property. However, it's always best to ask first.</p>

       	<p><b>A:</b> Voice recorders can be a handy resource, but it may make an interview seem more formal. Laws regarding

       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AL">In Alabama, one person must know that recording is taking place. </p>
       	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AL">The eavesdropping statute criminalizes the use of “any device” to overhear or record communications, whether the eavesdropper is present or not, without the consent of at least one party engaged in the communication. Ala. Code § 13A-11-31</p>
       
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AK">In Alaska, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AK">It is a misdemeanor in Alaska to use an eavesdropping device to hear or record a conversation without the consent of at least one party to the conversation, or to disclose or publish information that one knows, or should know, was illegally obtained. Alaska Stat. § 42.20.310. </p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AK">A person who intercepts a private conversation cannot legally divulge or publish the information without consent of at least one party. Alaska Stat. § 42.20.300. </p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AZ">In Arizona, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AZ">In Arizona, an individual must have the consent of at least one party to a conversation in order to legally intercept a wire or electronic communication, including wireless and cellular calls. Otherwise, this conduct is a felony. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-3005. </p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AR">In Arkansas, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_AR">In Arkansas, intercepting or recording any wire, oral, cellular or cordless phone conversation is a misdemeanor, unless the person recording is a party to the conversation, or one of the parties to the conversation has given prior consent. Ark. Code § 5-60-120. </p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CA">In California, all parties must know that recording is taking place. </p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CA">It is a crime in California to intercept or eavesdrop upon any confidential communication, including a telephone call or wire communication, without the consent of all parties. Cal. Penal Code §§ 631, 632. </p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CA">Eavesdropping upon or recording a conversation, whether by telephone (including cordless or cellular telephone) or in person, that a person would reasonably expect to be confined to the parties present, carries the same penalty as intercepting telephone or wire communications.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CA">Conversations occurring at any public gathering that one should expect to be overheard, including any legislative, judicial or executive proceeding open to the public, are not covered by the law.</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CO">In Colorado, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CO">In Colorado, recording or intercepting a telephone conversation, or any electronic communication, without the consent of at least one party to the conversation is a felony. Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-9-303. Recording a communication from a cordless telephone, however, is a misdemeanor. Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-1.3-401. </p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CO">Anyone who is not "visibly present" during a conversation who overhears or records the conversation without the consent of at least one of the parties commits a felony carrying the same punishment as a telephone interception, as does anyone who discloses the contents of such a conversation. Colo. Rev. Stat § 18-9-304.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CO">However, nothing in these statutes “shall be interpreted to prevent a news agency, or an employee thereof, from using the accepted tools and equipment of that news medium in the course of reporting or investigating a public and newsworthy event.” Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-9-305.</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CT">In Connecticut, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_CT">Conn. Gen. Stat. § 52-570d: It is illegal to tape a telephone conversation in Connecticut without the consent of all parties. Consent should be in writing or should be given on the recording, or a verbal warning that the conversation is being taped should be included in the recording.</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_DE">In Delaware, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_DE">Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, § 2402(c)(4): Delaware's wiretapping and surveillance law specifically allows an individual to "intercept" (defined as acquiring the contents of a communication through a mechanical device) any wire, oral or electronic communication to which the individual is a party, or a communication in which any one of the parties has given prior consent, so long as the communication is not intercepted with a criminal or tortious intent.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_DE">However, another Delaware privacy law makes it illegal to intercept "without the consent of all parties thereto a message by telephone, telegraph, letter or other means of communicating privately, including private conversation." Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, § 1335(a)(4). The wiretapping law is much more recent, and at least one federal court has held that, even under the privacy law, an individual can record his own conversations. United States v. Vespe, 389 F. Supp. 1359 (1975).</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_DC">In D.C., one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_DC">D.C. Code Ann. § 23-542: It is legal to record or disclose the contents of a wire or oral communication where the person recording is a party to the communication, or where one of the parties has given prior consent, unless the recording is done with criminal or injurious intent.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_DC">However, disclosure of the contents of an illegally recorded communication cannot be punished criminally if the contents of the communication have “become common knowledge or public information.” D.C. Code Ann. § 23-542</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_FL">In Florida, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_FL">Fla. Stat. ch. 934.03: All parties must consent to the recording or the disclosure of the contents of any wire, oral or electronic communication in Florida. Recording or disclosing without the consent of all parties is a felony, unless the interception is a first offense committed without any illegal purpose, and not for commercial gain, or the communication is the radio portion of a cellular conversation. </p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_FL">These first offenses and the interception of cellular frequencies are misdemeanors. State v. News-Press Pub. Co., 338 So. 2d 1313 (1976).</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_GA">In Georgia, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_GA">Ga. Code Ann. § 16-11-62: Secretly recording or overhearing a conversation held in a private place, whether carried out orally or by wire or electronic means, is criminally punishable as a felony under statutory provisions regarding invasions of privacy. However, the law expressly provides that it does not prohibit a person who is a party to a conversation from recording and does not prohibit recording if one party to the conversation has given prior consent. Ga. Code Ann. § 16-11-66.</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_HI">In Hawaii, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_HI">In Hawaii, any wire, oral or electronic communication (including cellular phone calls) can lawfully be recorded by a person who is a party to the communication, or when one of the parties has consented to the recording, so long as no criminal or tortious purpose exists. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 803-42. </p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_HI">The one-party consent rule does not apply, however, to the installation of a recording device in a "private place" that will amplify or broadcast conversations outside that private place. All parties who have a reasonable expectation of privacy in that place must consent to the installation of a recording device. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 803-42(b)(3).</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_ID">In Idaho, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_ID">In Idaho, although legislation criminalizes the interception and disclosure of wire or oral communications, it specifically allows interception when one of the parties has given prior consent. Idaho Code § 18-6702.</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_IL">In Illinois, all parties must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_IL">An eavesdropping device cannot be used to record or overhear a conversation without the consent of all parties to the conversation under criminal statutes. An eavesdropping device is anything used to hear or record a conversation, whether the conversation is in person or conducted by any means other than face-to-face conversation, such as a telephone conversation. 720 Ill. Compiled Stat. Ann. 5/14-1, -2</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_IN">In Indiana, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_IN">In Indiana, the recording or acquiring of the contents of a telephonic or telegraphic communication by someone who is neither the sender nor the receiver is a felony and can be the basis for civil liability. Ind. Code Ann. § 35-33.5-1-5.</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_IA">In Iowa, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_IA">It is a misdemeanor in Iowa under general criminal laws to tap into a communication of any kind, including telephone conversations, unless the person listening or recording is a sender or recipient of the communication, or is openly present and participating in the conversation. Thus, one party to a communication generally may record it without the consent of the other parties.Iowa Code § 727.8.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_IA">Iowa also has more specific legislation regarding the interception of communications that expressly allows the interception of wire, oral or electronic communications through use of a mechanical device by a party to the communication, or with the consent of at least one party, in the absence of any criminal or tortious intent. Iowa Code § 808B.2.</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_KS">In Kansas, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_KS">In Kansas, unlawful eavesdropping consists of secretly listening to, recording, or amplifying private conversations or using any device to intercept a telephone or wire communication “without the consent of the person in possession or control of the facilities for such wire communication.” Kan. Stat. Ann. § 21-4001.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_KS">The state’s highest court has interpreted the eavesdropping and privacy statutes to sanction one-party consent for taping of conversations and in interpreting both statutes stated: "In other words, any party to a private conversation may waive the right to privacy and the non-consenting party has no Fourth Amendment or statutory right to challenge the waiver." Kansas v. Roudybush, 686 P.2d 100 (Kan. 1984).</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_KY">In Kentucky, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_KY">It is a felony to overhear or record, through use of an electronic or mechanical device, a wire or oral communication without the consent of at least one party to that communication. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 526.010</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_KY">A person is guilty of eavesdropping when he intentionally uses any device to eavesdrop, whether or not he is present at the time. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 526.020.</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_LA">In Louisiana, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_LA">In Louisiana, unless a criminal or tortious purpose exists, a person can record any conversations transmitted by wire, oral or electronic means to which he is a party, or when one participating party has consented.</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_ME">In Maine, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_ME">In Maine, interception of wire and oral communications is a “Class C” crime under the state criminal code, and an interceptor is someone other than the sender or receiver of a communication who is not in the range of “normal unaided hearing” and has not been given the authority to hear or record the communication by a sender or receiver. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, § 710. </p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MD">In Maryland, all parties must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MD">Md. Code Ann., Courts and Judicial Proceedings § 10-402: It is a felony to intercept a wire, oral or electronic communication unless all parties to the communication have consented. But all-party consent will not make the recording legal if there is a criminal or tortious purpose behind it.</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MA">In Massachusetts, all parties must know that recording is taking place. </p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MA">It is a crime to record any conversation, whether oral or wire, without the consent of all parties in Massachusetts. Mass. Ann. Laws ch. 272 , § 99.</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MI">In Michigan, all parties must know that recording is taking place. </p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MI">In Michigan, a private conversation legally cannot be overheard or recorded without the consent of all participants.Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.539c.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MI">The eavesdropping statute has been interpreted by one court as applying only to situations in which a third party has intercepted a communication, an interpretation that makes it legal for a participant in a conversation to record that conversation without the permission of other parties. Sullivan v. Gray, 324 N.W.2d 58 (Mich. Ct. App. 1982).</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MN">In Minnesota, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MN">In Minnesota, it is legal for a person to record a wire, oral or electronic communication if that person is a party to the communication, or if one of the parties has consented to the recording — so long as no criminal or tortious intent accompanies the recording. Minn. Stat. § 626A.02. </p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MS">In Mississippi, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MS">It is generally a violation of Mississippi law to intercept and acquire the contents of wire, oral or other communications with a mechanical or electronic device. The law against interception of communications applies neither to a “subscriber” to a telephone who “intercepts a communication on a telephone to which he subscribes,” nor to members of the subscriber’s household. Miss. Code Ann. § 41-29-535, Wright v. Stanley, 700 So.2d 274 (Miss. 1997)</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MS">In addition, the law specifically provides that if a person is a party to a communication, or has obtained consent from any one of the parties, no liability can be imposed unless the interception was accompanied by a criminal or tortious intent. Miss. Code Ann. § 41-29-531.</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MO">In Missouri, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MO">In Missouri, an individual who is a party to a wire communication, or who has the consent of one of the parties to the communication, can lawfully record it or disclose its contents, unless the person is intercepting the communication for the purpose of committing a criminal or tortious act. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 542.402. 

	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MT">In Montana, an individual who is a party to a wire communication, or who has the consent of one of the parties to the communication, can lawfully record it or disclose its contents, unless the person is intercepting the communication for the purpose of committing a criminal or tortious act. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 542.402. </p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MT">It is a violation of privacy in communications under state law to record a conversation with a hidden electronic or mechanical device without the knowledge of all parties to the conversation, but the law does not apply to public officials or employees speaking in the course of their duties, to anyone speaking at a public meeting, or to anyone who has been warned of the recording.See Mont. Code ann. § 45-8-213.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_MT">Exceptions to this rule include the recording of: elected or appointed officials and public employees, when recording occurs in the performance of public duty; persons speaking at public meetings, and persons given warning of the transcription. If one party gives warning, then either party may record. Mont. Code ann. § 45-8-213-1-c-i, ii, iii. </p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_NE">In Nebraska, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_NE">In Nebraska, a person who is a party to a wire, electronic or oral communication, or who has obtained prior consent from a party, can record or disclose the contents of that communication without violating the law, so long as there is no criminal or tortious purpose behind the recording or disclosure. Illegal interceptions are felonies that can be punished with fines up to $10,000 and five years in prison. Neb. Rev. Stat. § 28-105.</p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_NV">In Nevada, all parties must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_NV">The Nevada wiretapping statute provides that it is a crime for anyone to "intercept" or disclose the contents of any wire communication, but that no illegal activity occurs when the interception is made "with the prior consent of one of the parties to the communication" and "an emergency situation exists."</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_NV">In December 1998, the state's highest court stated in a 3-2 decision that the wiretapping statutes require that an individual obtain the consent of all parties before taping a telephone conversation, and thus, that an individual who tapes his own telephone calls without the consent of all participants unlawfully "intercepts" those calls. Lane v. Allstate Ins. Co., 969 P.2d 938 (Nev. 1998).</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_NV">In addition, it is a criminal invasion of privacy to secretly listen to, record or disclose the contents of any private conversation "engaged in by other persons" through use of any mechanical or electronic device, "unless authorized to do so by one of the persons engaging in the conversation." Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 200.650.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_NV">Nevada statutory provisions also make it a crime to disclose the existence or contents of any wire or radio communication without permission from the sender or receiver.</p>

	<p class="statecontent statecontent_NH">However, it is only a misdemeanor if a party to a communication, or anyone who has the consent of only one of the parties, intercepts a telecommunication or oral communication. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann § 570-A:2-I. </p>
	
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_NJ">In New Jersey, one person must know that recording is taking place.</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_NJ">In New Jersey, interception of any wire, electronic or oral communication, or disclosure of the contents of such communication by someone having reason to know of the interception, is a crime. The disclosure of intercepted information is not a crime, however, if the contents of the communication have "become public knowledge or public information."</p>
	<p class="statecontent statecontent_NJ">In addition, an interception is legal if the interceptor is a party to the communication, or one of the parties has given prior consent, so long as no criminal or tortious intent is present. Nonetheless, even if a person is a subscriber to a particular telephone, that person cannot consent to the recording of conversations on that telephone to which he is not a party. N.J. Stat. § 2A:156A-4.</p>

       	<p><b>Q: Should I do an interview over email?</b></p>
       	
       	<p><b>A:</b> Interviews via email should be the very last option for a journalist, one used only when there is 
       	absolutely no other way to conduct the interview. Emailed interviews provide the source with a chance to 
       	“craft” a message, unlike with a real-time interview. If there is no other way, send questions one or two 
       	at-a-time, like in a real-time interview. Interviews conducted by email, ethically, should be disclosed 
       	within the story.</p>

	<p><b>Q: How should I go about interviewing an officer about an incident?</b> </p>
    	
    	<p><b>A:</b> Often, a Public Information Officer (PIO) will be at the scene if intensive media attention is expected. 
    	PIOs often are the only representatives at a scene. If you would like to interview an officer instead of a PIO, 
    	visit the local police station or ask the PIO to set up a contact for you.</p>
    	<p>Become familiar with the Sunshine Laws in your state to know what information a police officer is 
    	required to provide.</p>
    	<p>Viewing an arrest log can answer a lot of questions. Once you find an arrest that piques your interest, 
    	request a copy of the arrest report then interview the arresting officer for further details.</p>

    	<p><b>Q: Can I re-quote already published material?</b> </p>
    	
    	<p><b>A:</b> Above all, try to confirm the information on your own. Make every effort to get previously published 
    	information by your own efforts, because if the published information is false, you can be held responsible 
    	for republishing and lose credibility with your readers.</p>
    	
    	<p>However, if it is absolutely necessary to use published material, <b>always attribute</b> it, giving 
    	credit to the publication from which you pulled the information. Never take credit for a quote you did not

       	<p><b>Q: Should I fix a quote I got from someone?</b></p>
       	
       	<p><b>A:</b> Correct minor grammar mistakes (e.g. replace "gonna" with "going to"), in speech. Eliminate unnecessary 
       	filler words (e.g. "um," "ah"), or repetitive phrases that are meaningless (you could change, "so, for example, 
       	um, for instance..." into "For instance..."). Never clean up a quote in a way that changes the meaning of the

    	<p><b>A:</b> Photoshop ethics consist of one critical question: Do your changes make the photo misleading? With the 
    	advanced technology of Photoshop, it is easy to be pulled into overusing “quick-fixes," which could ultimately 
    	change the photo completely. Be mindful of your changes and your commitment to the truth. In other words, stay

       	<p><b>A:</b> Photographers will always own the rights to their photos regardless of whether an actual copyright 
       	has been applied.</p>
       	
       	<p>Copyright of a photograph protects not merely the photographer from direct copying of his work, 
       	but also from indirect copying to reproduce his work, where a substantial portion of it has been copied.</p>
       	
       	<p>Copyright - of any work - lasts for 70 years from the end of the year in which the creator dies.</p>
       	
       	<p><b>Q: What are creative commons images and how do I find them?</b></p>
       	
       	<p><b>A:</b> Creative Commons photos or content are a great way to illustrate or flesh out a story free of charge. 
       	The organization provides six different copyright-licenses, with various restrictions, free of charge to the 
       	public. The least restrictive requires attribution-only, but the most restrictive requires attribution, 
       	non-commercial use and use of the work with no alteration whatsoever. Be sure to check the license before

       	<p><a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/">search.creativecommons.org</a> provides a search service that can be used to find Creative Commons licensed 
       	work and it can be very resourceful when looking for a visual to represent a story. Even with creative commons 
       	images, it's a good practice to alert the author before publishing, especially if the license does not include

    	<p><b>Q: What's the best way to prepare for an interview with public officials?</b> </p>
    	
    	<p><b>A:</b> When interviewing public officials, make sure you have an interview plan set out in advance. 
    	Asking disjointed questions to a busy official who may not want to talk in the first place wastes time and effort. 
    	Officials are especially good at evading and dissembling questions while providing no meaningful content. 
    	If an answer starts to stray, don't be afraid to bring the interviewee back to the question by interjecting: 
    	"I'm still wondering about the original question," or "You didn't answer the question." 
    	If you do not understand an answer that the official gave, follow up with a question such as, 
    	“can you explain that in a way that the public can understand?” </p>

    	<p><b>Q: When do I need waivers and releases?</b> </p>
    	
    	<p><b>A:</b> Generally, releases are unnecessary for newsgathering purposes. 
    	However, if there is question about the newsworthiness of the recording, it's best to obtain a release first. 
    	You can face legal consequences if the video can be argued to be an invasion of privacy. 
    	If the video is going to be sold to viewers (e.g. sale of a DVD of a videotaped event) then a release may be 
    	necessary.</p>
	
	<p>If you are interviewing a minor, a release can be necessary if the parent is not present or did not give 
	explicit permission. Minors cannot sign their own release - a parent or guardian must sign it on their behalf. 
	If in doubt about the necessity of a release, err on the side of caution. </p>

        <p><b>Q: What can I bring to a court?</b></p>
    	
    	<p><b>A:</b> Each county courthouse will have its own rules on what you can bring into a courtroom. 
    	Generally, you can bring in paper and a pen to take notes. Some courtrooms forbid cameras -- including those 
    	embedded in mobile devices -- while some will admit them for certain cases. Typically, it's up to the 
    	judge’s discretion and can vary from case to case. Check beforehand so you are not denied access for bringing 
    	a mobile phone with a built-in camera.</p>

       	<p><b>Q: Should I interview children?</b></p>
	
	<p><b>A:</b> Avoid interviewing young children, especially if they have witnessed a traumatic event. It is essential 
    	to talk to a child in the presence of a parent and get parental consent before publishing or broadcasting the 
    	interview. If it is essential to talk to the child do so with an adult present - in a quiet place, away from 
    	the excitement of the scene. Do not, however, separate a child from his parent or guardian to interview her. 
    	Before publishing a photo of a child, get permission from a parent or legal guardian.</p>

    	<p><b>Q: Can a press pass get me into a press conference?</b></p>
	
	<p><b>A:</b> A press pass is a journalist's credential, issued and used to confirm his or her identity as 
    	a representative of a news organization. While press passes are not always necessary, some passes have a 
    	recognized legal status. Wearing a press pass may afford the journalist special access to restricted areas 
    	such as crime scenes, press conferences and events related to breaking news. However, a press pass does 
    	not guarantee admission.</p>       	
    	
    	<p><b>Q: How do I get permission to interview people on private property?</b></p>
	
	<p><b>A:</b> In most situations, journalists are not permitted to cover an event or interview on private property 
       	without prior permission. It's best to call several days in advance to request permission, especially if you 
       	are dealing with businesses or corporations. Often, a local branch needs to contact the corporate office 
       	before they can grant permission.</p>
       
       <p>Be friendly, forthright and persistent. If you do not hear back in a day or two, call again and ask how 
       	the approval process is going.</p>
       	
       	<p>Businesses may often impose restrictions on what you can or cannot record while on private property. This 
       	is often requires a negotiation as there is no set of hard and fast rules. The key to getting what you want 
       	is building trust with the source.</p>

	<p><b>Q: Can I film at a school?</b></p>
       	
       	<p><b>A:</b> Recording inside spaces at public schools is typically up to the school's governing board. The school 
       	does not have to allow recording inside classrooms, the school gym or dorm rooms. You may record a public 
       	school from a public sidewalk but be careful about using identifiable images of children. If you must record, 
       	try to get shots of the school name or marquee only. However, the best practice is to get permission before 
       	setting up your camera at a school.</p>
       	
       	<p>A private campus, on the other hand, can usually ban recording at its discretion. In a few states, there 
       	may be a right to record in privately owned areas open to the general public, such as private campus sidewalks 
       	and lawns, but the general rule is that a private campus can set its own regulations regarding access and 
       	filming.</p>
 	
 	<p>The technique of recording students from behind or in a way that would not identify them is a good way 
 	to persuade officials to grant permission.</p>

    	<p><b>Q: How can I receive press releases?</b> </p>
    	
    	<p><b>A:</b> Most journalists will receive press releases from the contacts they have established or through employer 
    	institutions. Ask public relations contacts to add you to their contact lists. If there are certain government 
    	agencies you cover frequently, check their website as there is often a link to sign up to receive press releases. Finally, there are several press release websites that can provide you with multiple releases. </p>

       	<p><b>Q: How can a Public Information Officers (PIO) help me?</b></p>
       	<p><b>A:</b> The primary responsibility of a Public Information Officer (PIO) is to provide information to the 
       	media and public as required by law and according to the standards of their profession. Many PIOs are former 
       	journalists, bringing unique and relevant experience to the position. PIOs are often your first point of 
       	contact with any business or government agency. It's a good idea to develop positive relationships with them, 
       	as they are your entry point into many stories. During crises and emergencies, PIOs are often identified by 
       	wearing helmets or vests with the letters "PIO" on them.</p>
       	
       	<p><b>Q: Can I use Wikipedia?</b></p>
       	
       	<p><b>A:</b> As the "free encyclopedia that anyone can edit," Wikipedia should be used with great caution. If necessary, 
       	use Wikipedia as a starting point for information. Build on what you’ve read in a Wikipedia article by doing 
       	further research of the cited works. And remember, use Wikipedia as a start, never as a finish.</p>

    	<p><b>Q: What information can I get from the Government for a story?</b> </p>
    	
    	<p><b>A:</b> The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) makes government documents available to the public. Technically, 
    	FOIA only applies to Federal information. FOIA requests must be made in writing (some federal agencies consider 
    	online submissions as ‘writing’) and can only be used for federal agencies. These requests cannot be used for 
    	records from Congress, the courts or by state or local government agencies. However, every <b>state</b> has 
    	its own public access laws that make records available. </p> 
 
	<p>There are nine exemptions that an agency can cite for refusing to release records. The most common reason given for denial is for national security interests.
	If an agency refuses your request, keep negotiating.</p>   
 
	<p>When filing a FOIA, be sure to cite the federal or state statute concerning public records. Spell out your request clearly, do not simply ask for a vague 
	number of type of record. The easier the request is to understand, the faster it can be fulfilled.</p>   
 
	<p>Government agencies can impose a fee for completing a FOIA request, however there are limitations on what they can charge. Journalists are often exempt from
	paying if the information can be proven to be of significant public interest; however it is often quicker and easier to pay a minimal fee. If you are willing to
	pay a small amount, declare that in your request with a statement such as: "I agree to pay reasonable duplication fees for the processing of this request in an 
	amount not to exceed $XX.XX. However, please notify me prior to your incurring any expenses in excess of that amount."</p>

    	<p><b> Q: How should I behave on Social media?</b> </p>
    	
    	<p> <b>A:</b> Be extra cautious of what you do on social media. Posts on Facebook/Twitter are forever etched in your history
    	and can come back to hurt you in the future. Make sure that whatever you post on social media is acceptable for your
    	viewing audience and for people who come across your account. These are public forums - don't put any information on 
    	there that you wouldn't want your audience to see.</p> 
    	<p>Journalists should do their best to maintain a professional image, which may mean creating an account 
    	for personal use and another account for professional use. If two accounts are being used, do your best to 
    	prevent them from overlapping. It is a good idea to make your personal account more private than your 
    	professional account.</p>

    	<p><b>Q: What are creative commons images and how do I find them?</b></p>
       	
       	<p><b>A:</b> Creative Commons photos or content are a great way to illustrate or flesh out a story free of charge. 
       	The organization provides six different copyright-licenses, with various restrictions, free of charge to the 
       	public. The least restrictive requires attribution-only, but the most restrictive requires attribution, 
       	non-commercial use and use of the work with no alteration whatsoever. Be sure to check the license before 
       	using an image, as there can be legal consequences to breaking the license requirements.</p>
       	
       	<p><a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/">search.creativecommons.org</a> provides a search service that can be used to find Creative Commons licensed 
       	work and it can be very resourceful when looking for a visual to represent a story. Even with creative commons 
       	images, it's a good practice to alert the author before publishing, especially if the license does not include 
       	preferred attribution. It's always best to use a full name and not a screen name in publication.</p>
       	
	<p><b>Q: What are the limits on photograph usage?</b></p>
       	
       	<p><b>A:</b> Photographers will always own the rights to their photos regardless of whether an actual copyright 
       	has been applied.</p>
       	
       	<p>Copyright of a photograph protects not merely the photographer from direct copying of his work, 
       	but also from indirect copying to reproduce his work, where a substantial portion of it has been copied.</p>
       	
       	<p>Copyright - of any work - lasts for 70 years from the end of the year in which the creator dies.</p>
       	
    	<p><b>Q: What can I do in Photoshop and still be ethically responsible?</b> </p>
    	
    	<p><b>A:</b> Photoshop ethics consist of one critical question: Do your changes make the photo misleading? With the 
    	advanced technology of Photoshop, it is easy to be pulled into overusing “quick-fixes," which could ultimately 
    	change the photo completely. Be mindful of your changes and your commitment to the truth. In other words, stay 
    	away from using tools that significantly alter content.</p>

    	<p><b>Q: Am I allowed to accept items from news sources?</b> </p>
    	
    	<p><b>A:</b> Ethically, it is not a good idea to accept gifts from sources; even a coffee or lunch can be called into question. 
    	Sometimes it's unavoidable to accept a meal or a drink paid for by a news source (for example, at an official's residence or in a company's private dining room). 
    	Whenever practical, however, avoid those circumstances and suggest dining where you pay your share or, better, meet in a setting that does not include a meal).</p>
    	
      
       	<p><b>Q: Can I accept items from conferences? </b></p> 
       	
       	<p><b>A:</b> Most journalists don't accept swag or gifts, for ethical reasons. Some journalists pride themselves on never accepting a gift 
       	from a source or at a conference.</p>
 
	<p>Accepting a big-ticket item for covering a story or attending a conference damages credibility. How would a source feel if they
	knew you had accepted an iPod or nice TV in exchange for covering a story? If you are unsure what to do - err on the side of caution.</p>
 
	<p>A good test when debating whether to accept an item is the "re-sale test." If the swag could be resold for money, say no. 
	That ballpoint pen with a logo on it? Maybe not a good thing to use when talking to sources, but the resale value is so low that it
	is not likely to be seen as a bribe for doing your job.</p>

    	<p><b>Q: What do I need to know about gender, sexual orientation and ethnicity?</b> </p>
    	
    	<p><b>A:</b> <i>Chicago Tribune</i> editor Gerould Kern described his newspapers' approach to this issue as “measured and responsible” when 
    	it comes to including race in a story. In his article, “When race is relevant in news coverage," he said,
    	“We do not reference race unless it is a fact that is central to telling the story.”</p>
 
	<p>This is a good guideline to follow and should also be applied when dealing with gender orientation.
	Always ask yourself: would you mention if the subject was white, or straight? If you would not, it is not 
	necessary to identify a person by alternate or other labels.</p>
       	
       	<p><b>Q: How should I interview people with disabilities? </b></p>
       	
       	<p><b>A:</b> The 2000 Census estimated that 49.7 million Americans age five and older have a disability, close to 1 in 5 people.
       	This means that it is very likely that while reporting, you’ll come across someone who has a disability. Remember, not all disabilities are visible.</p>
 
	<p>One basic rule is to be careful in mentioning if the source has a disability and what that disability is. If the information
	is not relevant to the story,leave it out.</p>

    	<p><b>Q: Can I re-quote already published material?</b> </p>
    	
    	<p><b>A:</b> Above all, try to confirm the information on your own. Make every effort to get previously published
    	information by your own efforts, because if the published information is false, you can be held responsible 
    	for republishing and lose credibility with your readers.</p>
 
	<p>However, if it is absolutely necessary to use published material, <b>always attribute</b> it, giving credit to the
	publication from which you pulled the information. Never take credit for a quote you did not obtain directly.
	If you do not attribute, you may get fired or suspend from your job for plagiarism.</p>
       
       	<p><b>Q: What can I do with “off the record” information?</b></p>
       	
       	<p><b>A:</b> Off the record information is confidential and cannot be published.</p>
       	
       	<p>If a source requests to go "off the record" be sure that is established before the interview. 
       	Make sure you both understand the limitations of any agreement you make. Off the record information
       	can be useful in uncovering related facts and finding other sources that are willing to speak on the record. 
       	But it can also severely limit what you can put in a story. Agree to off the record interviews with great caution.
 
	<p>If a source asks to be off the record, try to convince them to go on record. Often, sources don't understand what
	off the record means or how such designation can be seen as less credible.</p>
 
	<p>Frequently, sources only want to protect their names and not the information they share. This is called "on background." 
	In this situation it's essential to define with the source how you will identify them in the story, by a description such 
	as “a senior police official.”</p>

    	Eliminate unnecessary filler words (e.g. "um," "ah"), or repetitive phrases that are 
    	meaningless (you could change, "so, for example, um, for instance..." into "For instance..."). 
    	Never clean up a quote in a way that changes the meaning of the speaker.

       	<p><b>Q: Should I interview children?</b></p>
       
        <p><b>A:</b> Avoid interviewing young children, especially if they have witnessed a traumatic event.
       	It is essential to talk to a child in the presence of a parent and get parental consent before publishing 
       	or broadcasting the interview. If it is essential to talk to the child do so with an adult present - in a quiet place, 
       	away from the excitement of the scene. Do not, however, separate a child from his parent or guardian to interview her. 
       	Before publishing a photo of a child, get permission from a parent or legal guardian.</p>

       	<p><b>Q: How do I talk to victims and family of victims?</b></p>
       	
       	<p><b>A:</b> When approaching a victim, identify yourself as a reporter but be sure to establish a human connection 
         by expressing sympathy, condolences etc. Leave all equipment behind. Know what you are going to say in order 
         to avoid missteps, which can discourage the victim. Emphasize that you are giving them the opportunity to tell 
         their story. Use silence to allow a response. If they decline, don’t push, but instead ask if they can 
         recommend any other people to interview. Be sure to leave a business card so that the victim can contact you 
         if necessary to follow up. Ask for contact information and be sure to call back for afterthoughts or omitted 
         details.</p>
